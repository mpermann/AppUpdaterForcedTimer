# The script is for patching an app with user notification before starting. Parameter 4 is the name of the
# app to be patched, parameter 5 is the name of the app process, parameter 6 is the policy trigger name to
# install the app. The script is relatively basic and can't currently kill more than one process or patch
# more than one app. This is a forced update that does not allow deferral.

TITLE="Quit Application"
DESCRIPTION="Greetings Heartland Area Education Agency Staff

A critical update for $APP_NAME is needed.  Please return to $APP_NAME and save your work and quit the application BEFORE returning here and clicking the \"OK\" button to proceed with the update. Caution: your work could be lost if you don't save it and quit $APP_NAME before clicking the \"OK\" button.

The update will automatically proceed when the timer expires.

Thanks! - IT Department"
